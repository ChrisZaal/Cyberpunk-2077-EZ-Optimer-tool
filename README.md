# Cyberpunk-2077-EZ-Optimer-tool

How to use: Copy the 'CyberPunk EZ Optimizer.exe' to your install directory and start it.

The tool edits your Cyberpunk 2077\engine\config\platform\pc\user.ini with a preset of settings. -- Make sure to make a backup, in case you need it ---

Note: This tool changes certain settings for the game in a way the developer didn't meant to have it released with. Please use at your own risk and if you have any problem at all; change it back the way it's supposed to be.

I am in no way responsible for any harm or malfunction to your game or hardware. I honestly hope your game runs better.

Happy gaming! And kudos to the original builder of this app, which seemed to have released it with some extra code that my virus scanner didn't seem to like.
