# Cyberpunk-2077-EZ-Optimer-tool

How to use: Copy the 'CyberPunk EZ Optimizer.exe' to your install directory and start it.

Note: This tool changes certain settings for the game in a way the developer didn't meant to have it released with. Please use at your own risk and if you have any problem at all; change it back the way it's supposed to be.

I am in no way responsible for any harm or malfunction to your game or hardware. I honestly hope your game runs better.

Happy gaming!
